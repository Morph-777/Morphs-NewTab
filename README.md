# Morph's New Tab
This Chrome Extension aims to recreate the Firefox NewTab page for people who switched to a Chromium based browser.

> **⚠️ Early Development Notice:** This project is in early development. Features may change, break, or be incomplete.

### About
I built this project for myself because I wasn’t a fan of Brave’s default New Tab page.
After switching from Firefox, I wanted something that felt more familiar — so I recreated it and added many more customizaton options!
I decided to make it open-source and share it on the Web Store so others can enjoy it too.
