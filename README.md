# Morph's New Tab
This Chrome Extension aims to recreate the Firefox NewTab page for people who switched to a Chromium based browser.

> **⚠️ Early Development Notice:** This project is in early development. Features may change, break, or be incomplete.

### About
This project was made by myself for myself, because I don't like the default New Tab page of Brave Browser.  
I recently switched to Brave from Firefox, so I tried to recreate that experience. Decided to make it open-source and publish on WebStore for others to enjoy.
