### About
I built this project for myself because I wasn’t a fan of Brave’s default New Tab page.
After switching from Firefox, I wanted something that felt more familiar — so I recreated it and added many more customizaton options!
I decided to make it open-source and share it on the Web Store so others can enjoy it too.
