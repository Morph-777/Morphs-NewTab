**DISCLAIMER: WORK IN PROGRESS — THIS IS NOT THE FINAL VERSION.**

### About
This project was made by myself for myself, because I don't like the default New Tab page of Brave Browser.  
I recently switched to Brave from Firefox, so I tried to recreate that experience.

## Key Features

- **OPEN SETTINGS BY DOUBLE-CLICKING THE CLOCK!**
- **RIGHT-CLICK TO EDIT LINKS!**
- Designed to look like the Firefox New Tab page
- Clean Interface: just clock, search, and favorite links
- Smart Search with instant suggestions from browsing history and top sites
- Drag-and-Drop Links – Organize your most visited sites easily
- Modern default dark theme
- Keyboard Navigation – Quick access via arrow keys (search suggestions and link tiles)

## Customization Options

- Choose between 5 search engines (DuckDuckGo, Google, Bing, Yahoo, Ecosia)
- Adjust grid size (1–8 columns × 1–5 rows)
- Customize every color element
- Import/Export your link collections and color settings
- Choose a favicon source (custom file upload not yet supported)

## Perfect For

- People who switched from Firefox to Chromuim based browser
- Minimalists who want a clean start page
- Power users who need quick access to frequent sites
- Anyone tired of Chrome/Brave's default new tab

## Privacy

This extension respects your privacy — **no tracking, no ads**, just a fast and personal new tab experience.  
Permissions are only needed for suggestions in the integrated search bar.  
**No data is ever collected.**
